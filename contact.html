    </div>
    <div class="body1">
        <p>For my previous history on my pursuit for knowledge. I have been a hard worker my entire life. starting from my kindergarten times untill today. My memory from as far back as when I was in grade 1, reminds me of how curious and interested I was about how the nature around me worked. Not only this but I was also known for my good grades and my outstanding results. I remember the first school I attended at. its name was <em>"Nama Bori"</em> which is an oromic phrase that translates to <em>"people of tomorrow"</em> in english. Like I said I was born in this town Moyale found on the border of Ethiopia and Kenya. my point is I have had the chance to be taught by my kenyan teachers who crossed the border for small salaries to teach us english social sciences and basic sciences: One time I even got enrolled in a kenyan school called <em>"Amazing grace Academy"</em> when I was in grade 4 although I didnt stay long enough for the next year.It was an amazing experience for me though I got to learn a new language <em>"Kiswahili"</em> Kenya's Official language and their life style. I believe if it wasn't for this part of my life I wouldn't be as successful as I am right now. It was here that I mastered my english listening and speaking skills and my computing and critical thinking skills too thanks to my Teachers Both Ethiopian and kenyan.</p>
        <p>Ironically things even got better when we the whole family had to move to a near by city called yabelo right after I finished my 6th grade. I joined this new school with excellent teachers and the name of the school was <em>"Yabelo seventh day adventist school"</em> long huh? it is said the school was founded by missionaries long time ago. It was here I again mastered my mother tongue and amharic languages for we didn't use them as much as when I was in moyale. But what I dont forget is how our teachers were devoted and how they disciplined us. The environment was so perfect for learning teaching process that I become so devoted too that I scored the highest mark in my zone for my grade 8 national ministry exam. This title bought me a ticket that changed my next 4 years together with my entire life.</p>

        <p>The personality I have right now together with my thinking and processing ability totally changed after I got into this boarding school everyone in my region was talking about. In case you have heard about it the name of this boarding school is <em>"Oromia Development Association special boarding school"</em> or as I and my friends call it Oda. This is school is brand new actually my batch was just the second batch to join this school. It is founded by non governmental association by the name of ODA. To join this school there were criterias like your ministry result, your entrance examination result(The school prepared one for us) and many other stuff. This schools holds both my best memories and my worst memories it is a ground where I had to face my problems on my own without my parents or brothers it is also a place where I was free from my parents influence. I joined this school a child and I got out a man. Yea It had its ups and downs but still I am glad I joined there. Academically The teachers were also selected from different regions just like us. All of them have their Msc degrees some even Phd. we were prepared like soldiers are trained.</p></td>

            Well I finished my time in Oda and boy did I get out of there with good results. It was clear I wanted to join engineering of course but what really mattered was which colege am joining. fortunately, I got to join the number one Institute of technology in the whole country that is Addis Ababa Institute of technology(AAiT). It was my dream to one day become a software engineer. A programmer that had his little laptop, his glasses and his fingers but is revolutionizing the entire world and making it easier for people to live as day passes by. And the only way I could achieve this dream of mine was by joining the ITSC short for Information Technology and Scientific computing department.
            So I joined the department and is now on my way getting closer to my dream each day.
